- Each player gets 5 dice which will be rolled at the start of each round. If there are 3 Players then the total number of dice is 15.

- The first player calls out two numbers: how many dice on the table he or she thinks have been rolled as a number between one and six. For example, player one could say "two fives," which means he or she thinks there are at least two dice that are fives among all the players'. dice (including his or her own). 

- At this point, the next player can accept what has been called out and move on to their turn or call player one out, which will end the round and result in a winner for the round.

- If player one calls out "two fives," it does not matter whether player one has a five or not as bluffing is allowed in Liar’s Dice. It only matters if the next player believes player one is bluffing and calls him or her out on it. In that instance, all dice must be revealed.If player one is correct, the player wins the round. If player one is wrong, then player two is the winner. The round is then over.

- If player one's call is accepted, then it is player two's turn to calls out their numbers. The first number must be greater than what player one called.

- For example, if player one called out "two fives," player two must call out three or higher for his or her first number, so "three fives," "three fours," or four twos" would all be acceptable. "One five" or "two sixes" would be unacceptable.

- Game play continues until someone is called out.
